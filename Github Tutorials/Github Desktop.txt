To get started with this tutorial, you will want to download the Github desktop application from this link: https://desktop.github.com/

Then when you load the application and set it up, it is going to ask you for a repository that you would like to copy. You will need to get the link from the green code button at the top of the repository and copy the link. The alternative is you can open the repository in the dekstop app by pressing open in Github Desktop when you press the green code button.

From there it should have clone the repository to your local machine. Then when you make changes to files and documents you can go to that repository and upload them there. Once they are in the local repository, open the Github desktop app and it will show the changes made in the local file system. You then add a summary and description, optional, and press the commit button in the bottom left of the application. This will then upload the changes you made to any files on the web version of github.
