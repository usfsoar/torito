# Github Tutorials

Please follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo&list=PLWzABT4GTysfyFTM2mAiKjuKCykMu_FTr&index=1&pp=gAQBiAQB) for the basic understanding of github before reading further.

There are a few main components of github itself, as stated in the video github desktop is probably the eaisest way to use github. The reason I recommend github desktop is it intuitive and easy to navigate, while offering everything github has to offer. You can also access many features the github website also has to offer without having to login to the website.

### Terminology

The following are some keywords to remember when using github:

- Push - This will save any changes you made to a file to the github website.
- Pull - This will apply any changes that were made on the desktop that are not in your local files.
- Commit - Commit is sharing what changes you made before you push to the github website.
- Stage - Often time you will not see stage, but if you make changes you have to "stage" the changes before you can commit and push the modified file
- Fetch - This will also apply any changes that were made on the desktop that were not in your local files
- Sync - The most important one. After you commit your changes sync will sync with the github webstie files. This means if you made changes and someone else made changes and saved to the website before you, it will make sure your part is appended on.
- Merge Conflict - The second part to sync. This will review the changes made on the website and your local files. It will ask if you want to append to the already editied document that was saved on the github website. This will only show up as stated before if you try to modify a document that was recently updated and the most recent version was not saved on your local machine.
